<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>
Photobot 2000 is a snap to set up.  Its design makes it easy to transport and fits nicely table top.  It can even be hung on the wall like a picture frame. Just plug it in and press the power button and you are ready to go.  
</p><p>
There is a large front facing screen and a single arcade style button leaving no confusion on how it works. A burst of four photos are taken with a 3...2...1  countdown between each photo.  A short preview is shown to the user with directions how to retrieve the photo.  Iphone and android users can use a bar code scanner for even easier access to the photos instantly.
